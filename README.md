# word-count

This is code from a class I took a couple years ago where all code was developed on Linux servers.

The code needs compiling, and a Binary file was in the original folder, but I am not sure if that was necessary or not (it's been awhile).

This file will count the number of words and lines from a user-inputted file and print the result in the console.
